# Together

Together is a location based app to help bring LGBTQ+ locals together based on shared interests.

Users can customize their profile, sort through profiles, and compare their friendship-compatibility with others.

## Motivation

Most LGBTQ+ people meet each other through a dating app, a bar, or by being the only other LGBTQ+ person at the party. Together provides us with a way to see who lives nearby and wants to start an LGBTQ+ boardgame night or go for a bike ride!

## Progress

Currently, the geolocation and profile picture upload are not working properly. These will be implemented ASAP, as well as additional quality of life changes.
