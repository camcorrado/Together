# Together

Together is a location based app to help bring LGBTQ+ locals together based on shared interests.

Users can customize their profile, sort through profiles to determine their compatibility with others, and message each other to begin a beautiful new friendship!

## Motivation

Most LGBTQ+ people meet each other through a dating app, bar, or by being the only other LGBTQ+ person at the party. Together provides us with a way to see who lives nearby and wants to start an LGBTQ+ boardg ame night or go for a bike ride together!
